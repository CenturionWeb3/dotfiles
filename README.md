# dotfiles

This repo contains my personal VS Code settings, extensions, and shell preferences.

When connected to GitHub Codespaces, these files automatically configure my development environment to match my preferred setup.

### Included:
- `vscode/settings.json` – font size, theme, formatting, terminal behavior
- `vscode/extensions.json` – recommended VS Code extensions
- (optional) `.bashrc` / `.zshrc` – terminal tweaks

GitHub automatically clones this repo into every Codespace and applies the configurations.
